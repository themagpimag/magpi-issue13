In the unlikely case that you haven't already seen the video and don't know the name Amy Mather, I would like to introduce you to a young lady who hosted, quite possibly, the highlight presentation of the recent Manchester Jamboree, and who certainly has a bright future ahead of her in computer science. 

Amy's Game of Life presentation is available to watch on YouTube http://youtu.be/a35XINnYFtA and I would encourage you to watch the video first and then come back to read the remainder of The MagPi. 

After watching the first time I was astounded at Amy's confidence and ability and I had to watch it a second time. I couldn't help but think that Amy is a shining example of what all our kids could be if they are given the right resources, teaching and encouragement to experiment without fear.

-----------------

[MagPi] Most people have watched your video on the front page of Raspberrypi.org and have been astonished by your achievements with the Raspberry Pi and programming in general, what has been the feedback from that video? 

[Amy] The feedback from the Jamboree video has been amazing, with people asking me to do talks at more conferences, interviews, and things like design them a website etc. There have been so many lovely comments from people that I've never met so I'm really grateful to Alan O'Donohoe for giving me the opportunity to speak, I was really surprised when I was asked to talk alongside the likes of Steve Furber and Rob Bishop!

[MagPi] How did you first come across the Raspberry Pi?

[Amy] My Mum found out about Raspberry Pis on Twitter and ordered one for me on the day of release. It took a few weeks to arrive, but as soon as I got it I took to Ben Nuttall's first Manchester Raspberry Jam where I improved upon my Scratch version of Pacman using my face as the Pacman sprite and made a bat game for my little brother. (see Dan Hett's blog on Raspberry Pi Foundation website http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1396)

[MagPi] Before the Raspberry Pi came along, what was your experience with computers and electronics, did you work with other platforms?

[Amy] After Alan's first Hack to the Future in February 2012 a very generous geek, who was following the hashtag on Twitter, sent me an Arduino kit through the post. I incorporated it into a papier mache volcano for a school homework project that I was doing at the time and then I was asked to demonstrate it at Madlab in response to a 'call for makers' for the Manchester Mini Maker Faire that was a couple of months later. Around the same time I attended a Manchester Girl Geeks workshop that introduced me to Codecademy, I loved it so much that I went home and carried on... I've now got 50+ badges and have worked on CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP and HTML5 courses.

[MagPi] What do you most enjoy about using the Raspberry Pi, and what do your friends think about you playing around with computers?

[Amy] What I like most about the Raspberry Pi is the fact that you can make it do exactly what you want it to do, not be restricted by what's currently available.  My friends are a bit unsure about coding, they think that they just won't understand it or they'll find it boring but they do think that the end result is amazing. I'm working on ways to persuade them that coding is fun!

[MagPi] Obviously you are quite the accomplished programmer now, what were your first projects with the Raspberry Pi?

[Amy] My first project on the Raspberry Pi was a guessing game, it used the 'random' library to choose a different number each time for the answer and you have to guess what number it picked, it tells you if your answer is too big or small and deducts points each time you get it wrong, if you get one of the best scores then it asks for your name and saves your score into a high scores list.

[MagPi] What other programming languages have you been using on your Raspberry Pi other than Python, how have you found them? 

[Amy] The only other programming language that I've used on the Raspberry Pi is Scratch and although Scratch is a bit slow, both it and Python work well and are easily accessible.

[MagPi] No matter the country, there are often articles in the press about the poor IT and Computer Science teaching in schools. How have you found this to be in your case, is there much interest in gaining a deeper knowledge of computer science within your friends / classmates?

[Amy] No, most of my friends at school use a bit of HTML to update their Tumblr blogs and have done Scratch, Alice and Dreamweaver in ICT lessons but they don't really seem to want to take it any further.  I think that if Raspberry Pis and Arduinos were incorporated into ICT lessons (e.g. introduction to Python from age 11), Textiles lessons (e.g. Arduino Lilypad) or Product Design / Resistant Materials lessons (e.g. robots) then that could show them that programming can actually help you create some pretty awesome stuff and hopefully that would be enough to inspire them to start hacking and coding their own projects outside of school.

[MagPi] Are there Raspberry Pis available in your school already? If so, how are they integrated into your IT lessons and what benefit do they give you over the regular computer equipment that is available?

[Amy] No, unfortunately there aren't any Raspberry Pis in my school at all, but I'd like to change that ;)

[MagPi] What more can we do as a community to get more young people, both boys and girls into computer science? How could our individual readers get involved?

[Amy] I think that we need to set up more community hackspaces, like MadLab, that welcome kids through their doors. Readers could set up these kid friendly hackspaces and run events specifically for under 18's like Madlab's CoderDojos or set up code clubs in their local primary schools (www.codeclub.org) Your local STEMnet team (http://www.stemnet.org.uk) could help with setting this up if you're unsure.

[MagPi] If you were able to influence the Raspberry Pi design team and introduce a new model, what changes would you bring to the table? 

[Amy] I wonder if it would be a good idea to attach a 16x2 LCD screen to the board, so that once you've written your code for a project and it's on the Raspberry Pi, you could then just plug in a keyboard and a terminal-like environment would come up on the LCD screen. This would mean that you could run your code without having to plug in a monitor, making it easier to incorporate into projects.  I would also like to see if the design team could introduce a new board that could be incorporated into wearable electronics, along the lines of an Arduino Lilypad but even better! I like the fact that the Lilypad is washable, lightweight and easily attachable to fabric by conductive thread so if they could improve upon this, it would be great!

[MagPi] Do you feel there is anything missing from the Wheezy OS or that we need to work on to make it better for users like yourself?

[Amy] I've heard people mention that the desktop interface could be modernised, but I think that the content is great as it is. Maybe just give the user interface a bit of a face lift?

[MagPi] What are the best resources out there that you can recommend for young Raspberry Pi programmers, or people in general that are giving programming a go for the first time?

[Amy] Obviously, the MagPi magazines are a great resource :) but I think that the Super Scratch Book (http://nostarch.com/scratch) looks like a great book to help younger users of the Raspberry Pi, for older users Simon Monk's Python book (http://www.simonmonk.org/?page_id=63) provides a great introduction to the language.

[MagPi] Are there any particular podcasts, websites or video channels on YouTube that you find helpful that other kids might find a good source of inspiration?

[Amy] There are some very helpful resources online - I really like; www.geekgurldiaries.co.uk  http://learn.adafruit.com http://blog.makezine.com/projects http://www.instructables.com and http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage The twitter feeds @mykidcancode @codingforkids often have great links, too.

[MagPi] Implementations of the Game of Life can be quite daunting for a beginner, what projects would you encourage new young programmers to begin with? 

[Amy] Scratch (http://scratch.mit.edu) is probably the best place for young programmers to begin, but if you prefer working towards goals then Codecademy (http://www.codecademy.com) will probably be more helpful. On the Codecademy website you can choose to learn a particular language or work on a project e.g. one of the first games you'll make in the JavaScript course is Fizz Buzz. Alternatively, simple guessing games or rock-paper-scissors type games are a good place to start and there are plenty of internet forums where you can search for help with any queries that you may have.

[MagPi] In your presentation you mentioned Madlab and Manchester Hackspace, can you tell us a little about these resources and the benefits you get from going there?

[Amy] Without Madlab (http://madlab.org.uk) I wouldn't be talking to you today! They are AWESOME!!!! I've met so many great people there who are always willing to share their knowledge and teach me new things. At Madlab I have met; Mike Little, who was my mentor for YRS2012, Ben Nuttall who runs the Manchester Raspberry Jam (http://mcrraspjam.org.uk), Alan O'Donohoe who organised the Raspberry Jamboree, John Beckerson a senior curator from Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry who invited me to display at the Mini Maker Faire, Dr Lucie Green who is a space scientist, plus lots and lots of other very kind people who have taught me so much.  I've also been to lots of workshops held by Manchester Girl Geeks (http://manchester.girlgeekdinners.com) and have started helping teach at their workshops - there's just so much going on there!   Bob Clough from HacMan (http://hacman.org.uk) showed me how to use Inkscape to control the laser cutter when I was making the case for my 'Conway's Game of Life on Pi'. All the people at the hackspace are always happy to help people with any problems that they may have - I wish there was a MadLab/HacMan in every town to help other children discover their inner geek!

[MagPi] Are there many other kids around your age that go the these places on a regular basis? Can you tell us about the type of projects they are working on?

[Amy] At Madlab's U18 CoderDojo there's always lots of different activities going on, for example there's a maKey maKey kit which most of the younger users love making banana piano's with using scratch (http://www.makeymakey.com), a Lego WeDo kit (http://education.lego.com/en-gb/preschool-and-school/lower-primary/7plus-education-wedo) and Bare Conductive inks have been bought for the next event (http://www.bareconductive.com) There are always volunteers around who teach the us Scratch, Python, PHP,  Minecraft plus a variety of other skills.

[MagPi] You likely already have access to some nice gadgets such as laser cutters and 3D printers, what technologies are on the horizon that excite you?

[Amy] I love the idea of conductive inks.  I met Dr Kate Stone (http://www.novalia.co.uk) at the YRS Festival of Code last year and she showed me a pair of headphones that were made from paper, some electronic greetings cards that she'd made and also this jazz poster http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd4vTHOmQS8 It was amazing to see what she'd achieved with the technology. My mum bought some of Bare Conductive's products at the Maker Faire UK recently and I can't wait to try them out.

[MagPi] We're often asked by parents if their kids are old enough for a Raspberry Pi. Given your experience, what do you think is an ideal age for kids to be introduced to programming and do you think the tools available are adequate?

[Amy] I don't think that there is a minimum age; if a child can read and type, then they can learn to code!

[MagPi] As parents, what can we do, apart from buying a Raspberry Pi obviously, to spark our children's interest in computing?

[Amy] There is a computing festival http://www.casinclude.org.uk coming up soon (N.B. will the magazine have been release before June 15th?) in Warwickshire that is aimed at 11-13 year olds. Also, during the summer holiday, Young Rewired State (http://youngrewiredstate.org) is a week-long event where children up to 18 years old spend 5 days working with mentors on a project, using openly available data sets. Then, at the weekend, all the teams from across the UK meet up in Birmingham for the Festival of Code where they present their projects.

[MagPi] Finally, what new projects are you working on at the moment, are you able to give us a sneak peek?

[Amy] I've been offered a touch screen and larger LED array which, when they arrive, I will add into my 'Game of Life on Pi' to show at the Manchester Mini Maker Faire this summer.  Another idea is a 'T-Shirt of Life' which would be a T-shirt made from recycled materials with LEDs sewn on the front in a grid formation which would display the Conway's Game of Life.  What I'd really love to see though, is a Maker Faire exclusively for U18's - it could be called the Mini Makers Faire! It would be great if it were run like YRS with a week-long workshop beforehand using Hack Spaces and FabLabs with volunteer mentors and then at the weekend the children would present what they've made at the Mini Makers Faire - if anybody out there would like to help me do this, please get in touch! 

-----------------

Amy is a prime example of why we should be getting Raspberry Pis into the hands of as many kids as possible! It is young people like her that provide inspiration and drive to those within the Raspberry Pi foundation, The MagPi, and the wider community, to keep doing what there doing.

This certainly won't be the last time you hear of Amy in The MagPi, she is currently working on a number of articles for the magazine to help us encourage and challenge our younger readers.
